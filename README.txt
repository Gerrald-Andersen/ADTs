README.txt
This zip file contains several files and folders that should help you with investigating Abstract Data Types.

ADTs folder
There are 3 Python source files in here. Two contain the data structures themselves: stack, queue and binary search tree.  
The other contains tools to help you visualize the constructed data structures.
You should not need to read or modify any of these files.

imgs folder
Once working properly, all your images should appear in this folder as .gv files

sample_* files
A small collection of sample Python programs that show you how to call/use the ADTs.
You can put your own Python files here.
