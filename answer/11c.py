# For a stack, if we push an element and then immediately pop it, 
# we will get the element that was just inserted (LIFO).

# For a queue, if we enqueue an element and then immediately dequeue it, 
# we will also get the element that was just inserted, assuming the queue was empty beforehand (FIFO).
